BUnity is a Bash Unit testing framework. It's a so simple framework for give some testing features for Bash scripting. Actually, it offers only three functions:

* **setup**, which must be start the test script;
* **teardown**, which must be invoked as the very last function of the testing script; and
* **assert_equals**, to test equalities.

The script *test_example.sh* is an example of using it.

Enjoy!
